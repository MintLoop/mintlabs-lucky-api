        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Service Description</h2>
        <p>The Lucky Number Generator provides randomly generated numbers for entertainment purposes only. It is not predictive of lottery results, gambling outcomes, or financial returns. We make no claims as to accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or fitness for any purpose of the results. Your reliance on such results is at your sole risk.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">The Service includes various tools and features:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
          <li><strong>Random Number Generators (RNG):</strong> All number generators use random or pseudo-random algorithms for entertainment only. No tool predicts lottery numbers, gambling results, or financial outcomes. Past results do not influence future outcomes. No promise or implication of improved odds is made.</li>
          <li><strong>Casino-Lite Simulations:</strong> All casino-style tools (card games, dice, wheels, raffles) are fictional simulations for entertainment. All probabilities displayed may differ from regulated gaming odds. No real wagering, payouts, or gambling occurs. No skill, strategy, or tool provided increases real-world casino or gambling outcomes.</li>
          <li><strong>Educational Calculators:</strong> Probability, odds, and financial calculators provide educational demonstrations and may approximate or simplify statistics. These tools should not guide real-money decision-making. Nothing is guaranteed accurate, precise, or applicable to real-world events.</li>
          <li><strong>Fictional Currency Systems:</strong> Any fictional currencies (including but not limited to "MintyCatnipCoin" or similar) cannot be bought, sold, traded, redeemed, or converted to real currency. They hold zero monetary value and cannot be used in commerce. They are not blockchain-backed or financial instruments of any kind.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3"><strong>No Gambling or Financial Advice:</strong> The Service does not constitute gambling, financial advice, investment recommendations, or professional analysis. Users assume all risk from interpretation of outputs.</p>
