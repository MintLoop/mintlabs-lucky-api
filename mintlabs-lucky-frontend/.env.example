# API Configuration
#
# Browser API calls use /api (same-origin) which is:
# - Proxied by Vite in local dev (see astro.config.mjs)
# - Rewritten by Vercel in production (see vercel.json)
#
# Server-side/build-time API calls use BACKEND_ORIGIN:
# - This is NOT exposed to the browser (no PUBLIC_ prefix)
# - During SSR/build, absolute URLs are required for fetch()
# - Falls back to http://localhost:8000 if not set
#
BACKEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8000

# AdSense Configuration (only needed for production)
# PUBLIC_ADSENSE_CLIENT=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
