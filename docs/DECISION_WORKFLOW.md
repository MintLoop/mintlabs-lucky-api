# Decision-Making Workflow

All agents must apply this workflow when evaluating multiple approaches or uncertain tasks.

1. **Generate Options**
   - Propose 2–4 viable approaches to the problem.
2. **Analyze Each Option**
   - **Description**: concise summary of the approach.
   - **Assumptions/Preconditions**: conditions required for success.
   - **Pros**: strengths or advantages.
   - **Cons**: weaknesses, risks, or limitations.
   - **Effort/Complexity**: estimate (Small/Medium/Large).
   - **Evidence/References**: supporting docs, similar examples, or benchmarks.
3. **Quantitative Comparison**
   - Select 4–6 criteria (e.g., correctness, risk, cost/time, maintainability, performance).
   - Assign weights/scores for each option; show how options compare.
4. **Decide and Justify**
   - Choose the best option and explain why.
   - State why other options were not selected (key trade-offs).

**When to Use**
- Refactoring or design choices with multiple patterns.
- Performance optimizations (caching strategies, algorithms).
- Architecture decisions (sync vs async, DI patterns, etc.).
- Any scenario balancing maintainability, performance, or complexity.
